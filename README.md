# Oscilloscope Drawing Lib
 
A simple sample library to draw on a vector display, in my case my oscilloscope.
The library is capable of displaying arrays of vectors, circles, lines and rectangles.
I used an Arduino Due for this, since it have a 12 bit ADC, that in turn increases resolution.
Have fun with it, i most likly wont work on this further, it only serves as an example.
